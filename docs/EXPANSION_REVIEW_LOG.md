# Expansion Review Log

Internal record of candidate-geography and candidate-tier expansion reviews.

This log exists so expansion decisions are tied to concrete runs, publication ids, and explicit gate outcomes rather than oral history.

### Observed Output

- district count captured: 22
- candidate quality state: `complete`
- pending cases: `961280`
- disposal rate: `102.7`
- median case age days: `183`
- flagged districts: `3`
- top flagged districts in this run:
  - `Ludhiana`
  - `Amritsar`
  - `Jalandhar`

### What Cleared

- Source viability: the live NJDG Punjab source was reachable and produced a full stored raw capture.
- Extract and normalize reliability: the capture normalized deterministically into a valid candidate with a `complete` quality state.
- Publish safety and operations: `fetch -> inspect -> publish -> replay -> rollback` succeeded end to end against state-scoped `pb` artifacts.
- Rollback clarity: rollback restored the original Punjab publication cleanly after the replay publication.
- Operating evidence: a second independent Punjab window ran on 2026-04-16 at least 2 hours and 43 minutes after the first one, with the same statewide outputs and another successful replay plus rollback cycle.
- Public-readiness review groundwork: `docs/PUNJAB_PUBLIC_READINESS_REVIEW.md` now covers metadata shape, copy posture, and exposure-boundary assumptions for a future narrow public rollout.

### What Did Not Yet Clear

- Deployment readiness: the AWS runtime and live release flow still need an explicit Punjab rollout plan before public exposure on `https://nyaaywatch.in`.
- Live public verification: the state-scoped Punjab routes, CSV, and API still need browser and release verification against the real public hostname after deploy.

### Recommendation

Punjab is still the right first candidate state for the accelerated expansion track, and it has now cleared the internal evidence bar.

Punjab is ready for a narrow public deployment PR and rollout review.

Required next step:

1. Deploy the explicit Punjab state-scoped public surface intentionally.
2. Verify Punjab UI, API, CSV, and trust-metadata parity through the real public hostname.
3. Record the rollout result in the release and expansion docs.
