# Expansion Review Log

Internal record of candidate-geography and candidate-tier expansion reviews.

This log exists so expansion decisions are tied to concrete runs, publication ids, and explicit gate outcomes rather than oral history.

### Observed Output

- district count captured: 22
- candidate quality state: `complete`
- pending cases: `961280`
- disposal rate: `102.7`
- median case age days: `183`
- flagged districts: `3`
- top flagged districts in this run:
  - `Ludhiana`
  - `Amritsar`
  - `Jalandhar`

### What Cleared

- Source viability: the live NJDG Punjab source was reachable and produced a full stored raw capture.
- Extract and normalize reliability: the capture normalized deterministically into a valid candidate with a `complete` quality state.
- Publish safety and operations: `fetch -> inspect -> publish -> replay -> rollback` succeeded end to end against state-scoped `pb` artifacts.
- Rollback clarity: rollback restored the original Punjab publication cleanly after the replay publication.
- Operating evidence: a second independent Punjab window ran on 2026-04-16 at least 2 hours and 43 minutes after the first one, with the same statewide outputs and another successful replay plus rollback cycle.
- Public-readiness review groundwork: `docs/PUNJAB_PUBLIC_READINESS_REVIEW.md` now covers metadata shape, copy posture, and exposure-boundary assumptions for a future narrow public rollout.
- Live rollout verification: the deployed public stack now serves Punjab at `/states/punjab`, `/v1/states/punjab/...`, and `/states/punjab/data/districts.csv`, and `npm run release:verify -- --base-url https://nyaaywatch.in --state-slug punjab` passed with `districtCount=22`, `trendCount=1`, and CSV metadata parity confirmed.

### Operational Notes

- The live public runtime is now state-aware for read paths, but the public operator HTTP endpoints remain Himachal-scoped because the deployed app still binds operator routes to the single configured `STATE_CODE`.
- Punjab live publishing was therefore executed through one-off ECS tasks with `STATE_CODE=PB` rather than through `https://nyaaywatch.in/operator/...`.
- Follow-on release tooling should generalize state-scoped live publish helpers so future expansions do not require manual ECS task overrides.

### Recommendation

Punjab is now the first non-Himachal geography live on the public site, and the rollout cleared the narrow public expansion path without adding nationwide scaffolding.

The next expansion slice should not be more Punjab proof. It should be one of:

1. state-aware live release tooling and operator-route cleanup
2. one additional state trial using the same evidence discipline
3. a separate later track for High Courts rather than mixing court tiers now
